// Experimental: Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC), an opt-in, per-profile alternative
// to classic PID rate control, selected via pidProfile_t.pid_type. A third-order linear ESO
// (Extended State Observer) estimates the plant state (rate, its derivative, and a lumped
// disturbance term) and a virtual PD control law drives the estimated rate to setpoint.
//
// Builds on a proof-of-concept by Godwin Pious (@Boyyt357): https://github.com/Boyyt357/ADRC-betaflight
// Robustness fixes (liftoff gate, throttle-scaled b0, anti-windup, z3 decay) ported from
// danusha2345/ADRC-betaflight: https://github.com/danusha2345/ADRC-betaflight
